Ever since I was a little girl even younger than I am nowI always felt good about you in a special way, I don't know howAnd we always seem to find our way back to the love that we are sharingAnd every time we say it's over I can't forget your sweet lovingAfter every time we break up, thing always turn out the sameI tell myself that I have shaped up, but I am still a part of this gameYou always seem to come back into my lifeWhen I thought I've forgotten you, you always show upIt's drivin' me crazy, it's got me going wildAnd I don't know if this is ever gonna stopYou always seem to come back into my worldAnd this time I hope we're staying on track'Cause I don't wanna be anybodyelses girlI hope this is the last time you'll ever come backI want you back 'cause you're a good man,The kinda' man who loves you all through the nightAnd though it never turns like I plannedSomehow it feels so rightSo this time, boy don't turn away'Cause you'll always have a place in my heartAnd I swear I'm goona love 'til the day,'til the day that death do us part[Chorus]I don't have the strength to be proud anymoreI want it all to be just like beforeI guess what I'm really tryin' to sayIs that I want you to come back,Come back to stay 'cause I love you('cause I really love you)want to (I just want to)get closer (get much closer)than ever (more than ever)'Cause I love you[Chorus]Yes I do, yes I do I do love you baby and I'm telling you knowWhen I'm down you bring me up and when I'm up you bring me downSo what am I supposed to do when all I want is to get back with you baby
