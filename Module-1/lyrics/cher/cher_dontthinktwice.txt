It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babyIf'n you don't know by nowIt ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babyIf'n you don't know by nowWhen your rooster crows at the break of dawnLook out your window, and I'll be goneYou're the reason I'm a-travelin onBut don't think twice, it's all rightAin't no use in turning on your light babeThe light I never knowedAnd it ain't no use in turning on your light babeI'm on the dark side of the roadBut I wish there was something you would do or sayTo try and make me change my mind and stayBut we never did too much talkin' anywayDon't think twice, it's all rightSo it ain't no use in callin' out my name, galLike ya never done beforeAnd it ain't no use in callin' out my name, galI can't hear ya anymoreI'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' walkin down the roadI once loved a woman, a child I am toldI gave her my heart but she wanted my soulBut don't think twice, it's all rightSo long honey babyWhere bound I can't tellAnd goodbye is too good a word babySo I'll just say fare-thee-wellI ain't sayin' you treated me unkindYou coulda ever better, but I don't mindYou just kinda wasted my precious timeDon't think twice, it's all right
