Often things in life don't make senseIt's when the timing is right thins can happenAnd I feel that my clock is tickin'So if you wanna get with me, you better start thinkin'How I want to be loved by you babyHow I want to feel your sweet love for realCause I'm the bomb and soon I'll explodeDo you know which buttons to push, do you know my codeCause if you do I'm gonna take our destinyAnd turn it into freaky reality(That's how)How I know, well it's my female intuitionAnd something tells me that it's time for some actionCause I've been waiting for so long for the right momentto let you knowThat my desire is too string to let you go(How)[Chorus]You know it's all about timingThat rules everythingAnd tonight the time is right it is our night tonightTake your time don't let me stop youDo what you wanna doAs long as, as long as you will affect me with the things you doTonight's the night the time is right it is our time tonight
