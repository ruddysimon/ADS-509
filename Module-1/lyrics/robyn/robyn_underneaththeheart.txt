I look into your eyes and see a placeDrifting like a satellite in spaceLonging for a touch from someone who feels too muchAnd yet you hold up your wallsBefore I've gotten close enoughBut baby...I can see the glimmer when you open up the doorAnd that crack of shinin' light keeps me coming back for moreTo see[CHORUS]Underneath the heart, just before the lips,Right behind the soulWhat the mind has yet to knowThe dreams you can't beliveHave the love I need to seeThe place we have to start is right thereUnderneath the heartYou live inside a castle made of sandWhere tears would only hurt the way it standsI want to knock it down, start fresh on solid groundBut still you hide behind the truth like that's what life's all aboutBut baby...Words can not distract true love when true love is really realAnd the only way you'll know is if you show me how you feel[Chorus (x1)]You could spend your hole life in fear of painBut love is only as deep as the risk you takeAs the risk you take...[Chorus (x1)]
