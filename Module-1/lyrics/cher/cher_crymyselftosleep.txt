Every night, I lay my headOn my pillow on my bedAnd I just cry myself to sleepI know I shouldn't cryOver words that were all liesBut still, I cry myself to sleepEach night, I fight the tearsBut still they fallAnd all the memories linger onHe's gone, he's goneAnd now there's nothing but to cryCry myself to sleepStill, I cry myself to sleepEach night, I fight those tearsBut still, they fallAnd all the memories linger onHe's gone, he's gone, he's goneAnd now there's nothing but to cryAh, cry myself to sleepAh, cry myself to sleepAh, cry myself to sleep
