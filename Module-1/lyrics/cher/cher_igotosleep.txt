When I look up from my pillowI dream you are there with meThough you are far awayI know you always be near to meI go to sleep, sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI go to sleep, sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI look around me and feelThat you are ever so close to meThose tears that fall from my eyesBring back memories of you and meI go to sleep, sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI go to sleep, sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI was wrong, I was rightI will love you 'til the day I dieYou alone, you alone and no one elseYou were meant for meWhen morning comes once moreI have the loneliness you left meEach day drags by until nightFinally descends on meI go to sleep, sleepAnd imagine that you're there with meI go to sleep, sleepAnd imagine that you're there with me
