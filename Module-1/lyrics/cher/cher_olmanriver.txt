Here we all work 'long the MississippiHere we all work while the white folk playPullin' them boats from the dawn till sunsetGettin' no rest till the judgment dayDon't look up and don't look downYa don't dast make the white boss frownBend your knees and bow your headAnd pull that rope until you're deadLet me go 'way from the MississippiLet me go 'way from the white man bossShow me that stream called the River JordanThat's the old stream that I long to crossOl' Man River, that Ol' Man RiverHe must know somepin', but he don't say nothin'He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' alongHe don't plant taters, and he don't plant cottonAnd them what plants 'em is soon forgottenBut Ol' Man River, jest keeps rollin' alongYou and me, we sweat and strainBodies all achin' and wracked with painTote that barge and lift that baleYa get a little drunk and ya lands in ja-ailI gets weary and so sick of tryin'I'm tired of livin', but I'm feared of dyin'And Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along
