I'll send away all my false prideAnd I'll forsake all of my lifeYes I'll be as true as true can beIf you'll come and stay with meAll lovers of the past, I'll leave behindThey'll never be another on my mindI'll do all I can so you'll feel freeIf you'll come and stay with meThe promise I made most faithfullyI'll keep still if you decide to leaveI'll try and see that you have all you needIf you'll come and stay with meYes I'll be as true as true can beIf you'll come and stay with meLive a life no others have ever knownBut I know you think that I'm hardly grownOh thank God at last and finallyI can see you're gonna stay with meI can see you're gonna stay with me
