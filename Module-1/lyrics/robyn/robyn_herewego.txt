I couldn't wait another minute when I had you here again'Cause baby it's been more than minutes since we were more than friendsAll of this time I thought,I thought that nothing had changedBut it's all the sameHere we goOnce again you and I are more than friendsHere we goMakin' love againHere we goEven though we both know this is not rightHere we goMakin' love another nightMakin' lopve to you is easyIt's something that I missed so longBaby the way that you please me it feels so right It can't be wringAll of this time I thougt,I thought that nothing had changedBut it's all the same
