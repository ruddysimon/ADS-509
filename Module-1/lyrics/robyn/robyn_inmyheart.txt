Hope things will get better 'cause that's what I needI think about the good times that we had and now I see that you areliving in two different places and I don't think it's gonna be a changeBut I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep it In my heartIn my heartI'll keep it all togetherIn my heartI know it's gonna be betterIn my heartYou said that it should never be like this andwhen I was a little child I never had this on my mindBut now it is like it is and I don't think it's gonna be a changeBut I'm never gonna leave it I'm always gonna keep itIn my heart
