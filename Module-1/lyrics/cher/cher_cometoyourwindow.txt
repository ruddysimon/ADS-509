I'm leaving in the quiet early morningWhen night has left the skyBefore the dew is dryBut it's not like it used to beI'm leaving you this warningYou're gonna live to see the dayYou long for meCome to your windowIt ain't too late to comeInto your side againDon't make me believe youBefore you let me haveA chance to try againOr I'll be gone beforeYou ever know you're losing meI know I've made mistakesThat bought you sorrowBut baby, keep in mindYou're not right all the timeDon't let me go awayTo face a new tomorrowBack where you bought me fromWhen I was glad to comeCome to your windowLook down and see the teardropsIn my desperate eyesLook how I need youI got to find a way to make you realizeThat you are casting outThe deepest love you'll ever knowPlease don't close your earsTo what I'm sayingBefore I ride away into the early dayI spent the lonesome evening hours prayingThat you will change your mindAnd try me one more timeCome to your windowBefore our love comes crashingInto pieces on the groundDon't let it happenI promise you this timeI'll never let you downGive me a cause to comeTo your lonesome arms again
