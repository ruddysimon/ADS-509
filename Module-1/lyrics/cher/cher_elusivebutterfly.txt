You might wake up some morningTo the sound of something movingPass your window in the windAnd if you're quick enough to riseYou'd met the fleeting glimpseOf someone's fading shadowsOut on a new horizonYou may see the boat in motionOf a distant carib windAnd if you need press your earYou might hear footsteps runningThrough an open meadowDo be so concern it will not harm youIt's only mistress doing somethingI'm not sure ofCross my dreams with myths and wondersI'll take the brightest elusive butterfly of loveYou might have heard my footsteps echo softlyThrough the distant, from canyons of your mindI might have even called your nameAs I ran safely after something to believe inYou might have see me runningThrough the long abandon ruinsOf the dreams you left behindIf you remember somethingThey're the brightest path to follow closeI remember dreamingDo be so concern it will not harm youIt's only mistress doing somethingI'm not sure ofCross my dreams with myths and wondersI'll take the brightest elusive butterfly of love
