If I don't say what you want to hearIf I don't dress in what you want me to wearIf I don't think the way you doI can't help it 'cause that's my truthIf my humour makes you boredIf my religion isn't yoursIf my maturity doesn't fit my youthI can't help it 'cause that's my truth[CHORUS]See, the truth often hurtsBut if it's honest it's always worth itCan't deny that I'm subjectiveBut no truth can be objectiveEven though it's universalIt's always individualMy truth, your truth, his truth, her truthIt doesn't matter as long as it's trueIf my culture is something you don't knowIt's unfamiliar and it's uncomfortableI suggest you get to know my rootsBefore you judge me 'cause that's my truthIf your opinion is different from mineIf where I say go is where you draw the lineEven if I may not agreeI will accept 'cause it's your truth and it sets you free[Chorus (x1)]Don't you loose your truth, for whatever it's worthDon't you try to compromise with your own life[Chorus (x2)][Chorus fade out]
