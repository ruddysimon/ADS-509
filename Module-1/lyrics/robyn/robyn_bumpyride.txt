Sometimes life can be a bumpy rideSometimes it feels like you're drivin with covered eyesAnd you listen to your friend who's in the car by your sideThey say they've got your map, what if your friends are tellin' liesSo listen to your heart 'cause you can't see no roadsignsYou don't know where to stop or to turnEveryone goes through it I'm in the middle of mineAnd I try to remember it's the only way to learnHold on (you've gotta hold on)Hold on (you've gotta hold on)You gotta stay real true to yourself in the gameOf becomin' a woman where the rules never stay the sameRemember who you are, who made you and who's keepin' you hereWho's makin' you not duck for problems in fear?People in your way, dogs and bitchesWho's lickin' your ass? liers and snitchesEven though it's a bumpy rideKeep your head above the waterlineKeep focused and you'll make it throughKeep on rollin' is what you've got to doEven though it's a bumpy ride don't you slip and don't you slideLove will be there in the end when you come around that bendYou've gotta keep your flow smooth, never hesitateNever stop believin' always keepin' the faithBut always be critical never naive'Cause if you can be that there's so much more you can achieveMaybe then when you're grown up satisfied and strongMaybe then you will be happy, happy that you held on
