You say that I am all a gilr like me could beAnd you say that all that you need you find in meAnd that feels good, 'cause that is all a gilr wnats to hearBut are you telling me this baby just to keep me nearMy soul and all of my heart I'll give to youBut my trust is something that I put in fewSo baby if you want it all you've got to show meThat what you say you're gonna do is something that will become realitySo will you love me, let's say one year from nowAnd if you will baby can you tell me how'Cause I wanna know, I'm not gonna play the fool againI wanna be more than just another girlfriendJust another girlfriend, just another girlfriendSo this is it, this is where your choice has to be made'Cause I ain't goin' no further if I don't know what's aheadBut don't get me wrong, all I want is you to stay with me babyWon't you stay with me babyBut not here, not where we are today[Chorus]Will you leave or will you stay, will you stay another day
