It's not unusual to be love by anyoneIt's not unusual to have fun with anyoneWhen I see you hanging about with anyoneIt's not unusual to see me cryI wanna dieIt's not unusual to go out at anytimeWhen I see you out and about it's such a crimeIf you should ever want to be love by anyoneIt's not unusual it happens every dayNo matter what you sayYou'll find it's happens all the timeLove will never do whatcha you want it toWhy can't this crazy love be mineIt's not unusual to be mad at anyoneIt's not unusual to be sad with anyoneBut if I ever find that you have changed at anytimeIt's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you
