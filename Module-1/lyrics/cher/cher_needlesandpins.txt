Saw him todayI saw his face, it was the face I loveAnd I knew I had to run awayAnd get down on my knees and prayThat they go away but still they beginNeedles and pinsBecause of all my prideThe tears I gotta hideHey I thought I was smartI'd won his heartI didn't think I'd loseBut I see she worst to him than meLet him go ahead take her love insteadAnd one day he will seeJust how to say pleaseWow and get down on his kneesThat's how it beginsHurtin' him hurtin' himWhy can't I stop and tell myselfIt's wrong so wrongWhy can't I stand upTell myself to be strongBecause I saw him todayI saw his face it was the face I loveI can't let go, although I knowHe'll make me cry until the day I dieBut people I got to live nowWow Lord knows I should forgive nowThat's how they beginYou'll feel those needles and pinsSomebody stop'em nowStop those needles and pinsSomebody take'em away nowStop those needles and pinsSomebody stop'em nowStop those needles and pinsSomebody take'em away nowStop those needles and pins
