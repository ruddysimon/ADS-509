I was five and he was sixWe rode on horses made of sticksHe wore black and I wore whiteHe would always win the fightBang bang, he shot me downBang bang, I hit the groundBang bang, that awful soundBang bang, my baby shot me downSeasons came and changed the timeWhen I grew up I called him mineHe would always laugh and sayRemember when we used to playBang bang, I shot you downBang bang, you hit the groundBang bang, that awful soundBang bang, I used to shoot you downMusic played and people sangJust for me the church bells rangNow he's gone I don't know whyAnd 'til this day, sometimes I cryHe didn't even say goodbyeHe didn't take the time to lieBang bang, he shot me downBang bang, I hit the groundBang bang, that awful soundBang bang, my baby shot me down
