Do you know what I think all these nights when I can't sleep, sleep at allSlowly I close my eyesMy thoughts they fly away to you no matter what I doI wish I could turn back timeBack to the time when you were mine I wishI wish the day, the day you went away never happened babyI wish the stars, the stars in heaven would come down to meSo I could give them to youTell me then would you be lovin' me like I wishAnd it's so hard when you love someone this muchBut you just don't how, how to love him the right wayIf you could see, what you've done to meWhat you've done to my heart, what you've done to my soul babyAll of my mind and all of my body then you should knowWhy I can't let go and baby II wish the day, the day you went away never happened babyI wish the stars. the stars in heaven would come down to meSo I could give them to youTell me then would you be lovin' me like I wishI don't know what you want me to doTo prove my love is real for youI don't know what you want me do say babyThere is no if's or maybe'sAll I want is you 'cause baby you are my only wishMy only wish
