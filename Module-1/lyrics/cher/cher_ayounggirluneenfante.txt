She left her neighborhood in whichEveryone was filthy richShe left her parents at homeAnd strayed with a bagabondWho made vows of love she never heardAnd she believed his every wordShe left no forwarding addressShe just took her youth and happinessAnd with the boy she vanished inThe secret sweetness of their sinA young girlA young girl of sixteenChild of springtime still greenLaying there by the roadHe told her love-demanded spaceSo they roam place to placeAlthough she realized she sinnedShe threw caution to the windAs she followed him aroundWhile he slowly dragged her downSo overpowering was the loveThat he had madeIt captured all the young girl's heartsAnd soul and mineIn another words love drove her blindA young girlA young girl of sixteenChild of springtime still greenLaying there by the roadToo much emotion for a girlShe let her heart become her worldA world that God has never wroughtThat brought us under we are taughtHad she'd been wise and she had knownShe could of fed him love aloneShe should've know the day would comeWhen he would quit her for funHe needed fresh young meat to carveAnd left her heart and mind to starve
