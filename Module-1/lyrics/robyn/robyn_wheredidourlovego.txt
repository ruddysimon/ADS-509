Thoughts about you and meThinkin' about what we used to beLove was strong so were weUntil one day it all went wrongA new body a new faceBut no one good enough to fill your empty spaceBaby where did our love goI'm thinkin' about you and me nowBaby both you and I should knowWe should know by nowWarming heat coolin' shadeWhatever I needed I found in the love we madeMaybe this was meant to beMiss and reminisce of something close to exctasyBut I still hope that you feel our love inside the way I do[Chorus]Thoughts about you and meThinkin' about what used to be
